## General Information
Tarot cards have existed for centuries. The tarot card deck consists of 78 total cards divided into two main categories. The major arcana and the minor arcana. The major arcana cards consist of 22 trump cards that are numbered from 0 to 21, starting with 'The Fool' and ending with 'The World' respectively. These cards are typically said to symbolize major life themes.

The other 56 cards are the minor arcana. The minor arcana consists of four suits (Pentacles, Swords, Cups, and Wands). The minor arcana cards are said to depict everyday themes that can change more frequently day-to-day. It is also believed that each court symbolizes a different domain of themes. For example, pentacles are associated with finances and material possessions. Cups are emotions and feelings. Wands are energy, motivation, and passion, and swords are thoughts and logic.

Although originally designed as a standard playing card game, tarot has involved into a practice of divination, self-help guidance, and general entertainment. That being said, this app should be used for entertainment purposes only. The thought behind this app was a means to practice reactivity in Shiny in an alternative and fun way.
